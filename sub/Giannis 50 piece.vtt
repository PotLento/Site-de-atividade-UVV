00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Nobody Williams says Michele Bridges running the floor shot blocked by a tentacupolo once a game comes out of nowhere and throws it off the backboard

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Yadda's down the other anti-pansing move

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
I was standing job defensive not giving up on the play and then getting transition offense off of that

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
Just a tremendous in transition chase down play up right now with Fortis

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Yadda has had a coupons and Lopez all planes together

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
That is one long straw passing sequences. It's too much him holding on to the ball

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
The spin move the finish Yadda does it again the lead is up to 11

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
A tie-up flies holiday holiday trying to get it going one for 11 and fed a group who gets inside lay up he backs at home

01:04.000 --> 01:17.000
Five man and putting Yadda into the pick and roll and Paul is finding enough room and separation to get off his mid-range jumper

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
And the paint jumper for a tentacupolo 17 points here in the first half

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Look at his score with one point remaining in the second we back in the 90s

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Booker on the drive gets inside triple team finds cam Johnson shot clock winding down booker

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And a 24 second violation

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah, that's that's one of those with a violation hurts Milwaukee because Yadda's had a chance for a wide open dunk down the other end

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Tell you Yadda has been great scoring defending at time blocking the shot

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
This way as a player as a coach you deserve to be tied

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Holiday was brilliant in game five one of the best games of his life

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
That a couple gets to roll count it in one

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Assistant in his effort to run the floor

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Tries a three that's good Yadda said a couple with his first three point make of the night

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
He is giving his team life

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
He's on two coach drew a Philadelphia

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
But he was an all-star with the sixies

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
It's got a group home lays it up and in

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And set a group home calling for

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Goes against crowd against inside backer won't go the rebound back up and in

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Group strength from the honest on a buck squad by three time out Phoenix

02:51.500 --> 03:00.000
It's hard to handle that's where the health defense has to be there on the spin. You just look at how he is carried

03:00.500 --> 03:05.000
This team no one else on Milwaukee has it going offensively

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Back to us

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Back's in Lee's pulls up jump shot got it. Yadda's a pedicopo dominating right now

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
He is putting on a clinic. I like the adjustment go putting Jake Brown on him

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
At least those shots you can live with him make all of the first half when they were really struggling offensively

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Holiday inside the pedicopo lays it up and in

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Yadda some set thought he was found another great pass

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I

03:34.000 --> 03:38.500
It is sister holiday 35 points for a pedicopo state

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Once again, but we're on the drive let's have a shot block a pedicopo

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Josh lock it to crower has to put it up

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Here come the box for projection for Yadda's

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Middle from the bounce throws it up. Thanks shot

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I got a pedicopo on the follow

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
39 points for Yadda some 4 points

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
It's an outside

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Nice entry pass

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And the slider from the pedicopo

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
He's got 45

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Ball this places it picked up into the couple

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Don't pretend it fades away from the rim

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It's the presence of Yadda

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
A pedicopo on the glass

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
47 points box by eight

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
It's better than a box land right now

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Play looking

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Inside a pedicopo puts up the one hand or shot

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Is good doesn't again

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
49

04:50.000 --> 05:05.000
It's over the bucks have been it for a long way to send it after a half century the Milwaukee Bucks are NBA champions once again

05:21.000 --> 05:31.000
The emotions come pouring out

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
One of the greatest nights in the walkie sports history ends in a carnation

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And the brilliance of the young man from Athens

05:43.000 --> 05:52.000
Another crushing finish for Devon Booker and the Phoenix thumbs after a superb
